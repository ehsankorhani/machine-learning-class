# What is Machine Learning

In this article we will try to define Artificial Intelligence and compare it to Machine Learning, Data Science and Statistics.

## Artificial Intelligence
AI is simulating any intellectual or mental task.<br>
In contrast the robotics is focused on fulfilling the physical tasks.

<br>

## Goals of Artificial Intelligence

AI has few sub-fields such as:

* **Search and Planning** <br>
Is the process of searching through all possibilities and generating representations of future behavior prior to the use of such plans.<br>
i.e. Chess game.
* **Reasoning and Knowledge Representation**<br>
Is to represent information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition.<br>
For example, IBM Watson computer who competes in Jeopardy game and was able to defeat it's opponents.
Watson had to go through possible answers, reason about them, make conclusions and search the web for correct answer. 
* **Perception**<br>
Is the process of interpreting vision, sounds, smell, and touch. It helps to build machines or robots that react like humans.
* **Ability to move and manipulate objects**<br>
Which is the robotics algorithms.
* **natural Language Processing**<br>
Concerned particularly for how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data and communicate with humans.
* **Learning**<br>
Is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

**Machine learning** reaches to every other sub-set of artificial intelligence.<br>
It's applications includes;<br>
* Autonomous vehicles (drones, self-driving cars)
* Medical diagnosis
* Creating art, such as paintings and poetries
* Proving mathematical theorems
* Playing games
* Search engines
* Online assistants (such as Siri or Google Assistant)
* Image recognition
* Spam filtering
* Prediction of judicial decisions by going through thousands of existing cases to learn from 
* Targeting online advertisements
